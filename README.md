###	Using Supervised Learning and Statistical Analysis

*This report presents the results of utilizing supervised learning and statistical analysis to decompose and understand,
Parkinson's disease, which has no proper diagnosis and progresses differently from patient to patient. The goal is to
achieve a better understanding about the factors contributing to the diagnosis of this disorder to be able to construct an
efficient metric to diagnose patients with high probability of success. The research focuses on feature selection using
randomized decision trees and its success was measured on supervised learning classifiers. Furthermore, we explored the
distributions of the found features using basic statistics to determine how they are related and if any contribute to a positive
diagnosis. Our results show that with 0.995 accuracy and AUC, the data set can be classified for each patient as control or
having Parkinson's based on whether the patient produces non-zero values for NHY. Other features were also found to be
relevant.*
